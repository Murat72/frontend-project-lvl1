### BRAIN GAMES

«Brain Games» — a set of five console games based on popular mobile brain training apps. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered to be completed. Wrong answers end the game and offer to play it again. Games:

    • Parity check. The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a random number. And he needs to answer yes if the number is even, or no if it is odd.

    • Calculator. The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a random mathematical expression, for example 35 + 16, which needs to be calculated and written down the correct answer.

    • Finding the Greatest Common Divisor. The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown two random numbers, for example, 25 50. The user must calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.

    • Arithmetic progression. We show the player a series of numbers that form an arithmetic progression, replacing any of the numbers with two dots. The player must determine this number.

    • Is it a prime number? The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a random number. And he needs to determine whether it is simple.

### INSTALL

After cloning the project, run the following commands in the terminal from the project directory:

1. npm install
2. npm link
3. Select a game from the list. To launch the selected game, use the appropriate command:

   • Checking for even number: brain-even

   • Calculator: brain-calc

   • GSD: brain-gcd

   • Arithmetic progression: brain-progression

   • Is it a prime number?: brain-prime.
